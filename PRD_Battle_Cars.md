# PRD for Battle Car Multiplayer Game - Cursor Development

## Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Battle Cars
**Development Approach:** AI-Assisted "Vibe Coding" with Cursor IDE  
**Target Platform:** Browser-based multiplayer game  
**Development Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (staged approach)  
**Core Concept:** Real-time multiplayer car arena where players bump opponents to reduce health, with monetizable car upgrades inspired by fly.pieter.com's success model

## Development Stages Overview

### Stage 1: Proof of Concept (POC) - Days 1-3
**Goal:** Validate core mechanics and AI development workflow[1][2]

**Success Criteria:**
- Single car moveable with keyboard controls (WASD: forward, backward, left, right)
- Basic collision detection between car and arena walls
- Health system that decreases on collision
- AI successfully generates 80%+ of code via Cursor prompts

**Key Deliverables:**
- Arcade-style car physics (quick acceleration to top speed, simple steering)
- Oval-shaped arena with flat asphalt surface and wall boundaries
- Simple geometric car shape (rectangular prism)
- Health bar UI element
- Core game loop (update/render cycle)

**Cursor Prompts Examples:**
- "Create an arcade-style 3D car physics system using Three.js with quick acceleration and simple steering controls"
- "Build an oval-shaped arena boundary with flat asphalt surface and wall collision system"
- "Implement a health system that decreases on collision impacts with simple geometric car shapes"

### Stage 2: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - Days 4-10
**Goal:** Create functional multiplayer experience ready for initial testing[1][3]

**Success Criteria:**
- 8 players maximum per arena room (expandable to multiple rooms)
- Real-time car collisions affect all players
- Basic car upgrade system (3 car types minimum)
- Functional payment integration for upgrades
- Functional payment integration for advertisement space on arena walls
- Game sessions: "Last Car Standing" format with respawn after all players eliminated

- Player synchronization and state management
- Car upgrade shop with at least 3 tiers (Basic, Armored, Premium)
- Simple monetization system ($5-$30 car upgrades)
- Basic UI for health, player count, and upgrades
- Win/lose conditions and respawn mechanics

**Technical Implementation:**
- Frontend: Three.js for 3D graphics, Socket.io for real-time communication
- Backend: Node.js/Express server for player management
- Database: Simple JSON storage for player purchases (can upgrade later)

### Stage 3: Alpha Testing - Days 11-14

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Three.js (3D graphics), Socket.io (multiplayer), HTML5/CSS3
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io server
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL for user data and purchases
- **Hosting:** Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Railway/Heroku (backend)
- **Payments:** Stripe integration for car purchases

### Development Tools
- **Primary IDE:** Cursor with Claude Sonnet 3.5[8][9]
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub
- **Testing:** Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E testing
- **Monitoring:** Simple analytics for player behavior tracking

### AI Code Quality Assurance
- **Code Review Process:** Manual review of all AI-generated code before deployment
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit tests for core game mechanics, integration tests for multiplayer
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing for multiplayer synchronization
- **Security Auditing:** Regular security reviews of AI-generated authentication and payment code
- **Fallback Plan:** Manual implementation of critical features if AI quality is insufficient

### Testing Strategy for First 3D Game Project
- **Phase 1:** Manual testing of single-player mechanics (car movement, collision)
- **Phase 2:** Local multiplayer testing with multiple browser tabs
- **Phase 3:** Small group beta testing (5-10 players)
- **Phase 4:** Public beta with monitoring and crash reporting
- **Tools:** Browser dev tools, WebSocket debugging, performance profiling

## Monetization Strategy

### Freemium Model (Inspired by fly.pieter.com)[10][11]
- **Free Tier:** Basic car, limited customization
- **Premium Cars:** $2.99 - $9.99 range
  - Armored Car ($2.99): +50% health, slower speed
  - Speed Demon ($4.99): +30% speed, -20% health  
  - Tank ($9.99): +100% health, -30% speed, special ram ability (geometric tank shape)
- **Cosmetic Upgrades:** $0.99 - $4.99 skins, trails, horn sounds
- **Battle Pass:** $2.99 monthly for exclusive content

### Revenue Projections
Based on fly.pieter.com's success pattern[10][12]:
- Month 1: $5,000-15,000 (viral launch period)
- Month 2-3: $15,000-30,000 (sustained engagement)
- Month 4+: $20,000-50,000 (optimization and new content)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Server Scalability:** Start with simple hosting, plan for CDN if viral
- **AI Code Quality:** Implement thorough testing at each stage[13]
- **Multiplayer Sync Issues:** Use established Socket.io patterns[4]
